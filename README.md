## Mapbox Challenge

This is my attempt at solving the problem of rendering a map with the current loction centered, with a layer of
geojson data.

I first attempted to discover relevant examples online and read relevant docs, this took me longer than I anticipated.

I was able to render a map centered to the current user's location but unable to render the geojson layer in the time allocated.
